# CowinVaccinationAlertSystem
Vaccination Booking Slots are not available every time. So all people need to check Cowin Vaccine Portal frequently, which is very time consuming task. Hence to solve this issue, we can use a bot to get updates on Telegram. The bot will be sending messages/push notifications in group with all available slots in particular region/district.

Make sure to add your own personal bot's API_TOKEN and your groups CHAT_ID in script.py
